         <p>When looking at the food industry we can see that over the last couple of decades, dining became a more impersonal medium, customers have no connection with the chef, they are seated down by waiters, they do not see how their dish is made. </p>
<p>
If the customer is interested in a recipe he tasted, there is not much hope to learn how to cook it. The chef doesn’t have time to show the customer, which makes trial and error the only approachable option. Online tutorials / videos do not explain everything in detail, and nothing is comparable to one on one explaining. </p>
<p>When the person cooking is next to you, you develop a better understanding and can follow the process whilst asking questions and educating your inexperience, you learn to cook the dish and enjoy consuming in a different way, for a cheaper price, in a cozier socio-cultural setting.</p>

<p>The growing rate of other nationalities in a country triggers people’s natural curiosity to get to know the other culture and their traditional dishes. Those dishes usually come from an old family member and the recipe has been in the family for a long time. It is hard to gain knowledge of these traditions without being near the source while cooking. 
</p>  
<p>Urban Chef offers a solution to this and creates a platform were chefs and students can meet!</p>
